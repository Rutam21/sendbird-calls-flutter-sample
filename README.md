# sendbird_flutter_calls

A new Flutter project.

## Dependencies
The [textfield_tags](https://pub.dev/packages/textfield_tags) package has been added to conveniently enter in multiple userIds. This package has been slightly modified as to NOT automatically lowercase all tags - as Sendbird permits cased user ids.
